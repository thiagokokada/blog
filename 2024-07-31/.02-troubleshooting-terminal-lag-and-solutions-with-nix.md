# Troubleshoting: terminal lag and solutions with Nix

Inspired by this [blog post from
Tavis](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/slowterm.html), I decided to document my own
recent journey of reducing terminal lag startup. This post is way less
interesting than the one from Tavis that uses a debugger to patch applications
on the fly, but should still be interesting for some. And it also shows how
powerful Nix can be for some things.

For context, I have basically 3 systems where I interact with terminal
frequently:

- Thinkpad P14s Gen 1 running NixOS, with a reasonable fast CPU and disk
- [MacBook Pro "M1
  Pro"](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-m1-pro-10-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-16-2021-specs.html)
  (what an awful name scheme Apple) with a really fast CPU and disk, but of
  course running macOS
  + Sadly this is being phased-out since this is a job owned machine and I am
    changing jobs right now, but will be replaced with another one soon™
- [Chromebook Duet
  3](https://chromeunboxed.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-review-perfect-sequel)
  running ChromeOS, with slow CPU and disk

My experience is similar to Tavis, at around 300ms of startup time I don't care
too much, but around 500ms+ is where I start to notice. I never had any issues
with startup time in NixOS itself (I had issues with macOS before, but it was
not actually the fault of macOS), but in the Chromebook it was awful: 600ms+
with [hot
start](https://www.instabug.com/blog/understanding-cold-hot-and-warm-app-launch-time),
while cold start it could be multiple seconds.

The shell that I used is ZSH, and we check how long it takes to start by using:

```
$ time zsh -ci exit
zsh -ic exit  0.04s user 0.10s system 100% cpu 0.143 total
```

The `-i` flag here is important, because we are interested in the interactive
use of ZSH. Without this flag ZSH will ignore your `~/.zshrc` file, and the
results will be meaningless.

To do a more interesting benchmark, we can use [`hyperfine`](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine):

```
$ hyperfine "zsh -ic exit"
Benchmark 1: zsh -ic exit
  Time (mean ± σ):     145.4 ms ±   4.2 ms    [User: 49.8 ms, System: 97.3 ms]
  Range (min … max):   138.6 ms … 155.3 ms    19 runs
```

Hyperfine will run the command multiple times and take care of things like
shell startup time. A really great tool to have in your toolbox by the way, but
I digress.
